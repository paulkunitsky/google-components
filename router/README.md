# Router

The router requires a server-side component because of the deeplinking. In order to get that to work, you should clone the repo and do the following:

1. Clone the project.
1. Install the [Google App Engine SDK For Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python).
1. Run the SDK app to create symlinks.
1. Add it to the GAE Launcher you downloaded (Existing app, (Ctrl|Cmd)+Shift+N, /path/to/router).
1. Enjoy your local version of the router sample, probably at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
