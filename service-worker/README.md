# Service-Worker

This is a service-worker for our server-side-rendering session.

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies and run the server with `node index.js`.
Start Chrome Canary using `npm run chrome`, since HTTP/2 and ServiceWorker development
on localhost doesnâ€™t play nicely currently.
